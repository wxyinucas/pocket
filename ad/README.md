# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This is a project to record my learning path of [
Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html),
which is really a good book to guide me to the world of algorithms and data structure.

In the meanwhile, I also record my exercise on Hackerrank. There are many excellent problems to strenth your skills on CS.
